        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Swift is a powerful and intuitive open-source programming language developed by Apple Inc. It is designed to be easy to read and write, with a focus on performance, safety, and modern software design patterns. Swift is commonly used for iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS app development, but it can also be employed for server-side development and more.</p>

## Key Features
Swift offers a wide range of features:

- **Safety**: Swift includes features like optionals and type inference to help developers write safer code and avoid common programming errors.
- **Performance**: Swift is designed to be fast, with performance similar to that of low-level languages like C++.
- **Readability**: The language is designed to be easy to read and write, making code maintenance and collaboration more straightforward.
- **Expressiveness**: Swift provides expressive syntax that allows developers to write clean and concise code.
- **Interoperability**: Swift is compatible with Objective-C, allowing developers to use both languages within the same project.
- **Memory Management**: Swift uses Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) for memory management, reducing memory leaks and manual memory management.
- **Open Source**: Swift is open source, which means it has a growing community and can be used on a variety of platforms.

## Basic Syntax

### Variables and Constants
```swift
var myVariable = 42 // Variable
let myConstant = "Hello, Swift!" // Constant
```
### Data Types
Swift has various data types, including Int, Double, String, Bool, and more.

Control Flow
```swift
Copy code
if condition {
    // Code to execute if condition is true
} else {
    // Code to execute if condition is false
}

for index in 1...5 {
    // Loop from 1 to 5
}

while condition {
    // Loop while condition is true
}
```
Functions
```swift
Copy code
func greet(name: String) -> String {
    return "Hello, \(name)!"
}
let greeting = greet(name: "John")
Optionals
swift
Copy code
var optionalValue: Int? = nil // Optional with a default value of nil
if let unwrappedValue = optionalValue {
    // Unwrap and use the value if it exists
}
```
Examples
Here are some simple examples to illustrate Swift syntax:
```swift
Hello World
swift
Copy code
print("Hello, World!")
```

Calculate Sum
```swift
Copy code
func calculateSum(a: Int, b: Int) -> Int {
    return a + b
}
let result = calculateSum(a: 5, b: 3)
```
### Getting Started
To get started with Swift development, you'll need Xcode, Apple's integrated development environment (IDE), which includes the Swift compiler. You can download Xcode from the Apple Developer website.
